h1. May Be Deleted

This plugin is meant to be used in conjuction with <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid">acts_as_paranoid</a>. 

h3. Requirement / Use

Sometimes details of a record may be required, even if it has been deleted. 

For example consider a case of an ERP application where a user had created some data. User left the organization and hence was deleted from the system. Our application displays the name of creator while rendering any data. Thus a deleted user record needs to be found when displaying such data.

A better use is explained in <a href="http://tiduhere.blogspot.com/2009/09/view-and-edit-deleted-records-with.html">this blog article</a>.


h3. Usgae

Suppose we need to show the author_name of a deleted article.

We can write like:

<pre>@article.force_find("author").name</pre>

assuming that article belongs_to author

<pre>belongs_to :author, class_name => "User"</pre>
